// By default penthouse opens urls called in parallel in different tabs
// in the same browser, for performance reasons.
// If you need to run many pages however your machine will at some point
// (~ 10 pages) start running out of resources (causing crashes, errors and/or slowdown).
//
// Hence, better to setup a queue -
// this is just a simple example!
